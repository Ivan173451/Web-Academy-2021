      <p>This is one of my favorite movies as it does a great job of illustrating how a fictional group from a media called Warhammer 40k would behave and act during their activities. The movie starts with a group of elite soldiers ramming into a ship. The elite soldier then the elite soldiers which are called Adeptus Astartes kill everyone in the ship they rammed into before entering another planet from a sentient xeno device. The color scheme was used to show the darkness and mystery of the movies as there is no dialogue in the movie.</p>
