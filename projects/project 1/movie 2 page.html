      <p>Lupin III THE FIRST is one of my favorite movies as I have been a fan of Lupin III for 3 years and the interactions with the characters and the things that happen to each character is somewhat funny to me. The story of the movie revolves around Arsène Lupin III who is a thief attempting to steal a diary that his grandfather, Arsène Lupin, failed to steal. The color scheme of dark red and gray fits as these colors fit the feel of a thief that has lived off stealing and the grand feeling of trying to steal from a museum.</p>
