 <p>If the Emperor had a text-to-speech device is one of my favorite movies as the humor is interesting and the characters themselves are interesting. The writing in the movie is also pretty good as though it is mainly a comedy movie, it can get emotional. The movie is about a god-like being who used to lead the entirety of mankind but was put in a form of life support after fighting and killing one of his sons. After a group called the adeptus mechanicus gave the god-like being, called the Emperor of mankind, a text-to-speech device, he was able to command his empire again but he speaks a lot like a normal human. The color scheme represents the overall goofy and slightly weird feeling of the movie with yellow and the gray is meant to symbolize the occasional emotional event or moment.</p>
