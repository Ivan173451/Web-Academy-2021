  <h2>Information on Resting</h2>
    <p>The act of relaxing and resting has been prevalent throughout history. In certain religons and beliefs, relaxation is a core concept of the religious pratices with an example being meditation in Taoism. Not only is relaxation important in religious beliefs, it is also good for a person's mental health as it allows a person to take their mind off their stress. When a person relaxes, they give themself some time to recover from their life. This recovery is very important as it gets the person ready for the next day or task mentally and can make the person happier as the time used to relax can be seen as a reward for the person's hard work.</p>
