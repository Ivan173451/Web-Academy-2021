  <h2>Ways of Relaxing</h2>
    <p>Every person has their own way of entering their state of comfortability or calmness. Some prefer reading books while relaxing, some like music as their way of relaxing, and some like to lay down on their bed to relax. Some people do need multiple factors to relax. However, there is a difference between being relaxed and contemplation. A person shouldn't avoid thoughts while relaxing but thinking about something stressful or important shouldn't be done while relaxing as it changes a resting session into a procrastination session. In order to avoid this, people often do something while keeping their mind at peace. It can range from watching videos to playing games or cooking.</p>
