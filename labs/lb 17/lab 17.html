     <h2>Career Interest Profiler</h2>
     <p>In the career interest profiler, I got a score of zero for artistic, conventional, enterprising, investigative, realistic, and social "holland traits". A few of the recommended jobs I were given were "Physical Therapist Aides", "Tank Car, Truck, and Ship Loaders", "Massage Therapists", "Chief Executives", "Dental Assistants", and "General and Operations Managers". I believe that this is a good joke from the naviance website as it is stating that people with no interests are capable of obtain high positions or decent salaries. The future jobs or posiitons I would like to apply for are still being thought about and considered. This is a very difficult task due to the fact that I have very little interest in any form of occupation. The current last resort job I have thought up about is bartending.</p>
     
<p>The reason for this is due to the fact that It is the only subject that I have decent knowledge about. Bartending also relies on memory which is something I am good at sometimes. Maybe if I spent more time outside of my house then maybe I could find something interesting and interact with people more. Unfortunately, I am don't have anything to do outside, my parent would most likely not allow me to wander around aimlessly, and I do not have good social skills. One of my interests is video games.</p>

<p>Video games were something I have used to pass time and entertain myself for almost the entirety of my life. Due to this, I do not go outside too often. I usually play games that are most fun to play alone so I don't interact with other people while playing games. The reason why I have not chosen a job related to video games is due to the fact that all the jobs that are related to video games are not interesting to me. Being a streamer isn't something I want to do as I don't have good social skills, a video game designer is too stressful for me to be able to ignore it after work hours, I am not good with any competitive multiplayer video games, and I don't have the humor to be a </p>
