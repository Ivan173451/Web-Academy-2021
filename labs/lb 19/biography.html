  <h1>Biography</h1>
  <p>By Ivan Chow</p>
  <a href="https://web-academy-2021.ivanchow3.repl.co/">Return to Home page</a>
  <p>I currently have no desired job in mind. The interests I have are things I do not want to become jobs. These interests are video games and music. The current job I have chosen is bartender as it relies on memory which is something I am decent at. Unfortunately, I have limited social skills and my ability to start conservations and interaction is going to be difficult for me. The main reason for getting my job is to be able to support myself without relying on someone else. being able to have acess to water, shelter, clothing, and food would be the basics. A computer and internet is a secondary priority for me as these two are my main sources of entertainment. The bed picture represents the fact that I need to sleep. The blackscreen is there to signifiy my aimlessness. The computer picture is there because it is my main source of entertainment. The words "food" is there to show one of my basic human needs. The house represent my need for shelter. The interenet picture is what allows my computer to provide entertainment for me. The job picture is something I need for my human needs. The watercup picture shows my basic human need for water.</p>
